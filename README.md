# FitCLIP

This repo contains the code for the BMVC 2022 paper [FitCLIP: Refining Large-Scale Pretrained Image-Text Models for Zero-Shot Video Understanding Tasks](https://bmvc2022.mpi-inf.mpg.de/939/).

**Note: Unfortunately, we're still waiting for Adobe to approve the code release request. We hope the code to be publicly available soon, which we'll be available under this GitHub repository.**
